# RailRoadbarons
This is a monopoly inspired game that is played by claiming railroad track. The player who has the most connected railroad by the end of the game will win.

THE GUI component was implemented by my university but the usage of model-view-controller was implemented by me and the back-end logic
/algorithm were also implemented by me.
